            a testament to unwavering determination, fearless leadership, and an
            unyielding commitment to liberate India from colonial rule. Netaji's
            legacy continues to inspire generations, reminding us of the
            indomitable spirit that can drive a nation to achieve the
            impossible.

            Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, Subhas Chandra Bose
            showed early signs of leadership and a thirst for knowledge. His
            education took him to Cambridge University in England, where he was
            exposed to the injustices of British colonialism, fueling his
            passion for India's freedom.

            Returning to India, Bose joined the Indian National Congress, where
            he became a prominent leader. However, his ideological differences
            with Mahatma Gandhi led to his resignation from the presidency of
            the Congress in 1939. He believed in a more assertive approach to
            gaining independence.
